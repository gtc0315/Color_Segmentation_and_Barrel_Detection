This project is written by Tianchang Gu for the course project Color Segmentation and Barrel Detection.

###steps to run###
1. edit folder path in main.py 
	folder = "testset"
2. change direction to current path and run
	python main.py
3. press any key to continue when an image pops up

###special library requirements###
cv2, numpy, pickle, PIL, pylab, matplotlib
python2.7

###folder contents###
There are three class files for Gaussian model, linear regression model, and color class.
	GaussianModels.py
	LinearRegressionDistanceModel.py
	ColorClass.py

There is one library for the cleaness of the code.
	Helper.py

There are three scripts for training, classification, build dist model.
	training.py
	classification.py
	BuildDistModel.py

There are two pickle files for storing Gaussian model and linear regression model.
	classify_model
	dist_model

There is a cache image for storing image mask temporarily
	cache_classified.jpeg
